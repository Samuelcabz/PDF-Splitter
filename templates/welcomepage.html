               Unspoken Words Begin: October's Gift
            </div>
            <div class="timeline__event__description">.
                <p>October holds a special place in my heart because it marks the month when we first met and the beginning of our journey together as a couple. The moment I first laid eyes on you, it felt like the world faded away, leaving just you and me. Your kindness and beauty captured my heart instantly, and your smile has since become my favorite sight. Our weekends spent indulging in movie marathons in my room are moments I cherish dearly. I adore how you prefer the coziness of home over bustling outings. Each day with you is a gift, and as we step into November, I'm filled with excitement for the future, especially for our upcoming first monthsary. I want you to always remember how deeply I love you. You are my everything, and I'm endlessly grateful for your presence in my life. You've transformed my world, turning my despair into happiness. Thank you for being my source of healing and for bringing so much light into my life. I love you <3</p>

               Embracing the Unexpected: A Month of Love and Understanding
            </div>
            <div class="timeline__event__description">
                <p>This month has been unexpectedly wonderful. Despite your preference for indoor dates, I've been pleasantly surprised by your willingness to venture outside, especially after I've encouraged us to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors. Our nightly dinners out have become a highlight for me, though there are moments when I notice you lost in thought, and it concerns me. I often wonder if there's something bothering you, whether it's related to us or your family. Whenever I ask, you assure me that everything is fine, but I can't shake the feeling that something's amiss. Nonetheless, I've cherished every moment spent together, especially when I accompany you home to ensure your safety. Your beauty and angelic smile never fail to captivate me. Our first monthsary celebration was truly memorable. From our movie theater excursion to our lively dinner conversations, I've treasured every moment shared with you. I love you more than words can express, and I'm grateful for all the joy you've brought into my life. Thank you for being you i love you.</p>

                Choosing Love: Committed to the Path Ahead
            </div>
            <div class="timeline__event__description">
                <p>December was the month when we weren't together because you were too busy with school, and I was occupied with work. After that, I went home to my hometown to celebrate Christmas and New Year with my family, so we were in a long-distance relationship. However, I felt a coldness from you; you didn't answer my calls, and we rarely chatted because you said you were busy. But despite that, I still love you so much, and I was really happy to celebrate Christmas talking to you on the phone. I really miss you, Jagi.

My contract at work is ending this month, and the regional director asked me if I wanted to extend it for 2024. I didn't hesitate to answer and chose to extend my contract because I want to be with you in Davao. That's how much I love you. I choose you no matter what. My parents told me to go abroad in 2024, but I choose to stay in Davao with you. I love you big time Jagi.</p>

                Reflections on Love and Moving Forward: A Journey of Healing
            </div>
            <div class="timeline__event__description">
                <p>This January, we broke up. You said you wanted to prioritize your family first, and I understand that. I'm here to support you always, and I'm willing to wait for you after you graduate. But you said not to wait, and it's time to move on. I'm so sad; I cry every night, asking myself what's wrong, what's my problem. I didn't go to work for a week, just drinking alcohol every day in my room, crying. I rarely go outside; I only leave to buy alcohol. I'm tired of this month; I'm really hurting. I love you so much, but you gave up so easily. I miss you, and I miss my family. It's so sad because I'm alone here, drinking and crying, with no one to talk to. But I have new roommates in the apartment; they are so kind, and they make me happy. I'm very blessed to have these friends; they've changed me. Now, I understand that we weren't really meant to be; it was just an experience to learn something. Now, I'm okay, still healing and enjoying my life with my new friends here. I just want to say thank you, Jagi, for loving me. We were only together for 3 months, but for me, it felt like a century. I hope you will be successful in your life ahead. Thank you so much. I love you.</p>
